# Robot
This Project is about a phone controlled robot. The robot is coded using an arduino, and the motors used for the robot can be
bought online. The HC0-5 bluetooth module is used to take in bluetooth signal from a samsung phone. An important note is that
the the motors needs some kind of H-bridge to be reversed, I used an L298N prototype board as an H bridge. The robot takes in different numbers
as serial data to be used to determine if it moves forward, backwards, or stop.
